### Description

In order to practice developing with AngularJS, this project creates a webapp for a kombucha taproom. It allows customers to view a list of flavors available along with information about the brand, price and levels of kombuhca remaining in each keg. Additionally, it provides an employee view where users can dynamically edit information about each keg, keep track of kombucha levels, and add new kegs to the available offerings.
